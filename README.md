# netflix_data_visualization_project

In this project I were supposed to creat following visualizations using matplotlib, seaborn and pandas modules:

1. The distribution of the stock prices for the past year.

2. Netflix's earnings and revenue in the last four quarters.

3. The actual vs. estimated earnings per share for the four quarters in 2017.

4. A comparison of the Netflix Stock price vs the Dow Jones Industrial Average price in 2017

More detailed specifications and visualizations can be found here: https://github.com/vshakun/netflix_data_visualization/blob/master/netflix_visualizations.ipynb
